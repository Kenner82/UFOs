# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview
Using javascript, HTML, and CSS, a dataset of UFO sightings was inputted into a dynamically created table that can be filtered by any combination of date, country, city, state, and shape inputted by the user. 

## Results
 Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
 
Using the "Filter Search" input boxes on the left side of the page, users can type in any combination of criteria that will automatically filter the dataset. If a user types in a date, such as 1/2/2010, only results from that date will be displayed.

The user can then type in a second criteria, such as only displaying results from California, and the dataset will be filtered down even further.
